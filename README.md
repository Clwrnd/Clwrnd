# Hey ! 🍉

I'm **Clément Idmont**, I'm an engineering student in **Electrical Engineering** at INSA Strasbourg.

I enjoy doing little computer science projects of various types and with differents programming languages (mainly **Java**). Going from computer or mobile application to 
data analysis and more scientific oriented project.
